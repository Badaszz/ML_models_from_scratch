# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch, using only Python and NumPy.  
The goal is to demonstrate a strong understanding of the mathematics, intuition, and code behind each model, without relying on high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn.

## üìö Implemented Algorithms
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent Optimization
- Single-Layer Neural Network (Binary Classification)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- k-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit learn 
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter
